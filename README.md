# GD PNGTuber

Use your microphone to swap a pair of PNGs, move them up and down, as well as dim and fade, all configurable in-app, all inside a transparent window. Designed to be recorded using OBS Game Capture, just make sure to check the "Allow Transparency" and uncheck "Capture Cursor" in your Game Capture Properties!

## TODO:
- Add a release build on Github
- Add a demo screenshot/gif
- Combine duplicate custom Sliders/classes into Scene instances
- Add support for sprite sheet animations
- Add support for split/layered animated images (for avatar blinking, etc)

## Special Thanks:
